# Synchrounous-FIFO-Verification-SystemVerilog

This repository contains the complete SystemVerilog testbench and design files for verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) module *without* using UVM. Below is a breakdown of each file and its role in the verification environment.

## üî∑ Introduction

This project presents a **SystemVerilog-based testbench** for verifying a **synchronous FIFO buffer**.  
A FIFO is a critical component in digital systems, acting as a temporary storage queue that manages data transfer between modules operating at different speeds or clock domains.

Our design features multiple control and status signals such as `full`, `almostfull`, `empty`, `almostempty`, `overflow`, and `underflow`, ensuring safe and efficient data communication.

The verification framework rigorously tests these features using **structured SystemVerilog components** like transactions, monitors, scoreboards, and coverage to provide **comprehensive functional verification**.

|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `clk`          | Input         | Clock signal for synchronous operations                                     |
| `rst_n`        | Input         | Active-low asynchronous reset                                               |
| `data_in`      | Input         | Input data to be written into the FIFO                                      |
| `wr_en`        | Input         | Write enable ‚Äî data is written when high and FIFO is not full              |
| `rd_en`        | Input         | Read enable ‚Äî data is read when high and FIFO is not empty                 |
| `data_out`     | Output        | Data read from the FIFO                                                     |
| `full`         | Output        | Indicates FIFO is full ‚Äî prevents further writes                            |
| `almostfull`   | Output        | Indicates FIFO is almost full ‚Äî one write away from being full              |
| `empty`        | Output        | Indicates FIFO is empty ‚Äî prevents further reads                            |
| `almostempty`  | Output        | Indicates FIFO is almost empty ‚Äî one read away from being empty             |
| `overflow`     | Output        | Signals an overflow event ‚Äî write attempted when FIFO is full               |
| `underflow`    | Output        | Signals an underflow event ‚Äî read attempted when FIFO is empty              |
| `wr_ack`       | Output        | Acknowledges that the write was successful                                  |
